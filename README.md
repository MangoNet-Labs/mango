# Welcome to Mango Network

Mango Network is a Layer 1 blockchain based on the DPoS consensus mechanism and supported by Move to build a transaction-based infrastructure network.

## Mango Highlights

Mango offers the following benefits and capabilities:

1. Mango Network modularization  
2. MOVE, a secure smart contract language that can be used by mainstream developers  
3. Redefines digital assets on the blockchain  
4. Suitable for the explosive growth of Web3, enhances network performance, reduces development obstacles, and improves user experience  

Mango is the only blockchain today that can scale with the growth of Web3 while achieving industry-leading performance, cost efficiency, programmability, and usability. As Mango approaches its Mainnet launch, it will demonstrate capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systemsâ€”both traditional and blockchain-based. Mango is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, serving as a foundational layer for Web3.

## Mango Network Introduction

Mango Network is a Layer 1 blockchain, written in Rust, based on the DPoS consensus mechanism and supported by Move, to build a transaction-based omni-chain infrastructure network.

MGO is the native token of this blockchain.

MangoNet Labs is a Web3 blockchain company providing infrastructure.  
Our vision is to onboard 1 billion users into Web3. We achieve this by using the Move language as the underlying technology, which is suitable for the explosive growth of Web3, enhances network performance, reduces development obstacles, and improves user experience.
