# Welcome to Mango Network

Mango Network is a Layer1 blockchain based on the Dpos consensus mechanism and supported by Move to build a transaction-based omni-chain facility infrastructure network.

## Mango Highlights

Mango offers the following benefits and capabilities:

1. Mango Network modularization
2. MOVE, a secure smart contract language that can be used by mainstream developers
3. Redefine digital assets on the chain
4. Suitable for the explosive growth of Web3, enhance network performance, reduce development obstacles, and improve user experience

Mango is the only blockchain today that can scale with the growth of web3 while achieving industry-leading performance, cost, programmability, and usability. As Mango approaches Mainnet launch, it will demonstrate capacity beyond the transaction processing capabilities of established systems – traditional and blockchain alike. Mango is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform, a foundational layer for web3.
