## Code Quality & Conventions  

### Rust

- Handle errors gracefully using `Result` and `Option`.  
- Keep the code safe and efficient, adhering to Rust’s memory safety features.  

### Move  
- Use explicit types where necessary and keep code readable.  
- Ensure safety and clarity, especially in smart contract logic.  
- Write tests and provide documentation where applicable.
