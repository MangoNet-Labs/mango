Mango provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for interacting with the Mango network, its functionalities, and the Move programming language. The complete tool suite is referred to as MGO CLI, with commands grouped together based on functionality. Each group of commands is typically referenced by its top-level command: MGO Client CLI, MGO Console CLI, MGO Keytool CLI, MGO Move CLI, and MGO Validator CLI.

## Checking MGO CLI

Before using MGO CLI, you must have it installed. To check if MGO CLI is available on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```bash
mgo --version
```

If the terminal or console returns a version number, it indicates that you have installed MGO CLI.

If the command is not found, please follow the instructions in the Mango installation guide to obtain MGO CLI on your system.
