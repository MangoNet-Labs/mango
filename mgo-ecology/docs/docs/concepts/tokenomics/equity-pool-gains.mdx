title: Equity Pool Gains
---

At the end of each epoch: the Protocol distributes stake rewards to the participants of the DPoS mechanism.

The formula for calculating equity awards is as follows:

`reward_amount = voting_power / total_voting_power * computation_reward_amount`

## Parameter description

Voting rights, calculated as follows:

`let threadhold = min(10000,max(1000, 10000 / <Number_Of_Validators>));`

`voting_power = min(<Equity_Pool_Balance_Of_Validators> / <Total_Equity_Pool_Balance> * 10000, threadhold);`

### Total Voting Power

The total voting power is a fixed value of 10,000.

### **Computation Reward Amount**

computation_reward_amount = computation_charge(computation charge charged by current epoch) + stake_subsidy(equity subsidy for current epoch) - storage_fund_reward_amount(storage_fund_reward_amount)

storage_fund_reward_amount = total_storage_charge(storage_charge charged by all objects in the current chain) x computation_charge(computation_charge charged by the current epoch) / total_stake(total amount of MGOs in the current pool of all verifier pledges + total_storage_charge)

storage_fund_reinvestment_amount(storage_fund_reinvestment_reward_amount) = storage_fund_reward_amount x storage_fund_reinvestment_rate(storage_fund_reward_share reinvested in the storage fund, default 5%)

## Equity Subsidy

- Initial subsidy = 1000000 (1st epoch subsidy)
- Decay Period = 10 epochs (decay every 10 epochs)
- Decay rate = 10%

That is, current epoch subsidy amount = initial subsidy * (1 - decay ratio) ^ (epoch ~/ decay period) *,* i.e.  1000000 * 0.9 ^ (epoch ~/ 10).

| Epoch | Subsidy |
| --- | --- |
| 0~9 | 1,000,000 |
| 10~19 | 900,000 |
| 20~29 | 810,000 |
| … | … |
| 240~249 | 797,600 |

## Examples

At the end of the 92nd epoch

- computation_charge = 5.455
- storage_charge = 1084.76
- total_storage_charge = 2180.53(total_storage_charge of the previous epoch + storage_charge of the current epoch)
- total_stake = 172780089.689269653

storage_fund_reward_amount
= total_storage_charge x computation_charge / total_stake
= 2180.53 x 5.455 / 172780089.689269653
= 0.000068843

storage_fund_reinvestment_amount
= storage_fund_reward_amount x 5%
= 0.000068843 x 5%
= 0.000003442

computation_reward_amount
= computation_charge + stake_subsidy - storage_fund_reward_amount
= 5.455 + (1000000 x 0.9^(92~/10)) - 0.000068843;
= 5.455 + (1000000 x 0.9^9) - 0.000068843
= 5.455 + (1000000 x 0.387420489) - 0.000068843
= 5.455 + 387420.489 - 0.000068843
= 387425.943931157

reward_amount
= voting_power / total_voting_power * computation_reward_amount
= 2000 / 10000 * 387425.943931157
= 77485.1887862314
