title: Storage
---

The database used for storage is RocksDB.

RocksDB is an embedded key-value storage engine written in C++, where both keys and values can be binary streams. Developed by Facebook based on LevelDB, it provides backward-compatible LevelDB API.

Storage mainly consists of two parts:
1. Transaction Data
2. Consensus Data

## Transaction Data

Each validator node initializes the data file storage location based on the `db_path` parameter in the node configuration file. It initializes the database operation object using the default database configuration. There are mainly four objects:
1. `CommitteeStore`: Stores the mapping of each epoch ID to committee information.
2. `AuthorityPerpetualTables`: Contains data for each epoch and main chain data.
3. `ExecutionCache`
4. `CheckpointStore`

### Main Data Tables

| Table Name              | Purpose                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| OBJECTS_BLOCK_CACHE_MB  | Object block storage      |
| TRANSACTIONS_BLOCK_CACHE_MB | Transaction block storage |
| EFFECTS_BLOCK_CACHE_MB  | Transaction effect mapping|
| EVENTS_BLOCK_CACHE_MB   | Event storage             |
| INDIRECT_OBJECTS_BLOCK_CACHE_MB | Move object storage|

### Data Storage

#### Initialization / Recovery

If there is data in the database, the node state is restored based on the data.

#### Transactions

After the transaction is checked and confirmed, it gets the RocksDB operation object through `AuthorityPerpetualTables`. The processed content of the transaction is then submitted to the RocksDB transaction and finally executed to complete the data storage.

## Consensus Data

Consensus data mainly consists of the following three objects.
1. `CertificateStore`: Responsible for storing DAG certificate data.
2. `ConsensusStore`: Stores current consensus data.
3. `RandomnessStore`: Stores the final vote digest of each authority.

### Main Data Tables

| Table Name   | Purpose                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| certificates | Mapping of CertificateDigest to Certificate, saving certificates by digest ID |
| last_committed | Latest round committed by each validator |
| committed_sub_dag | Global consensus sequence |

### Data Storage

#### Certificates

Whenever a certificate is received, the data in `CertificateStore` is updated, and the latest certificate is written to it.

#### Consensus Progression

When a certain amount of certificates is received, the consensus round is progressed. `ConsensusStore` stores the data of the new round. The purpose of storing this data is to ensure that the consensus state can be recovered through `ConsensusStore` in case of system crash.

#### DKG

Whenever the consensus round is updated, the state of `Randomness` is pushed forward, and the corresponding data in `RandomnessStore` is updated.
