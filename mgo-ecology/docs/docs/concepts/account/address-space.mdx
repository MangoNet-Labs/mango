title: Address Space
---

An address is a built-in type in Move used to represent locations in global storage. An address value is a 256-bit (32-byte) identifier.

In Mgo, objects, accounts, and packages each have their own addresses for basic identification. Additionally, the address types are all the same, consisting of 64 characters in hexadecimal format. In Mgo, objects can be owned by other objects. For example, an account can own objects, and objects can also contain other objects.

## Mgo Account Addresses

Mgo follows widely accepted wallet specifications in the cryptocurrency industry, including BIP-32 (and its variant SLIP-0010), BIP-44, and BIP-39, to provide key management for users. Currently, Mgo supports pure Ed25519, ECDSA Secp256k1, ECDSA Secp256r1, and multi-signature for signing transactions.
To derive a 32-byte Mgo address, Mgo uses the BLAKE2b (256-bit output) hash function to concatenate the signature scheme flag, which contains the public key bytes.

## Mgo Non-Account Addresses

### Pre-allocated Object Addresses in Mgo

- System Address: 0x0
- Mgo System State Object: 0x5
- Clock Object: 0x6
- AuthenticatorState Object: 0x7
- Random Object: 0x8
- DenyList Object: 0x403

### Addresses for Standard Libraries and Official Packages in Mgo

#### Mgo Move-Stdlib 0x1

In Mgo, Move continues to use the address `0x1` as per Move language convention, named address `std`.

Move-Stdlib mainly consists of basic definitions and functions for MgoMove, which is the core standard library from the upstream of Move.
